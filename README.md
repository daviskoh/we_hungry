We Hungry Food Generator App

Purpose: This app generates food recommendations
to the user.

It learns user's preferences for
certain ingredients via the user's thumbs up/down
assignment for a particular food. 

An algorithm ranks the ingredients by votes
and returns the user's top preferred ingredients.

Then a food containing those ingredients is found.


Difficulties: 

This app involved complex * heavy datamodelling
as well as significant ruby logic in order to
execute its core function.

Also, the data used was not created for the purposes
of this app so significant manipulation had to be
done before being presented to user.

Making the user interface very friendly also
only added to the necessary ruby logic.
